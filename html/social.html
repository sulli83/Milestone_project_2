        <p>Local Authority direct provision: Local Authorities are directly providing housing to people on the social housing list.
        However, there has been limited delivery of new social housing at scale by Local Authorities in recent years when compared 
        to historic volumes provided in this way.
        
        AHB direct provision: Much of the social housing stock in Ireland is provided by Approved Housing Bodies, regulated
        by the Housing Agency and the Charities Regulator. While the Approved Housing Bodies have been adding to their stock (including through developments on sites provided by NAMA through the NARPs scheme or financed under the CALF and CAS schemes), the overall volumes being added and the scale of the Irish AHB sector is relatively modest compared to the overall need cited above.</p>

      large scale social housing development. This suggests an negative opinion of such development due
